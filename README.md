# Agricultural Drought Prediction Using Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System
Different drought measurements indicate different levels of severity, which can depend e.g. on the duration of dryness, the response of the vegetation to dry conditions, the amount of water stored in rivers, water reservoirs or in the soil. We have used a combination of two algorithms to predict Agricultural Drought - Artificial Neural Networks and fuzzy logic set. The combination of neural network and fuzzy logic is called as neuro-fuzzy logic. Rainfall is a crucial parameter to assess Agricultural drought and NDVI based indices can capture agricultural drought satisfactorily. Parameters we have used for drought prediction are Standard Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), SPI of six months time scale (SPI-6) and Moisture Adequacy Index (MAI). We train the neuro-fuzzy model with the training dataset and it predicts the occurrence of drought using test dataset. The Drought prediction is implemented for Bellary District of Karnataka.The KSNDMC Dataset folder contains rainfall and temperature data. Using that dataset, we have implemented Neuro-fuzzy logic for prediction of drought
